# Employee Attrition Prediction using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict whether an employee is likely to leave the organization
using machine learning techniques. The analysis helps HR teams understand key factors
that influence employee attrition.

## Dataset
IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset  
Source: Kaggle

## Target Variable
- Attrition (Yes = 1, No = 0)

## Model Used
- Logistic Regression

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Classification Report

## Accuracy Achieved
- 88%

## Steps to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository
2. Open `employee_attrition.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code
3. Run all cells sequentially

## Conclusion
The Logistic Regression model performed well with an accuracy of 88%.
Further improvements can be achieved using advanced models and
class balancing techniques.
